### Weather Report
Have you ever gone on google or your weather app on your phone to check out the weather for today? I have many times, which is why creating a code to display important weather information for a specific city. How the code works is by asking the user to put in the city that they are wanting to find the weather for. Once that is done it will display the temperature, high and low of that day, humidity, and a short description. On a technical side, an API pull was created and then scrapped of all data based on the city name that was provided from the user![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70404362/132248977-4c41d5a8-b06b-45da-9e44-d35260a62d39.png)
